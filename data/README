The `tar.gz` files contain the processed binary data needed by fairseq.

If you want to get the raw data (SMILES for molecule and amino acid sequneces for protein), please refer to the [read_binarized.py](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/v0.10.2/scripts/read_binarized.py) script in the fairseq codebase.
